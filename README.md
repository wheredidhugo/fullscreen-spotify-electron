# How to use:

## Make sure you have [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed (it is recommanded to download the 14.17.3 LTS version)

## Step 1: Download this application

Clone this repository

## Step 2: Last.fm Linking

If you don't already have an account on [last.fm](https://last.fm), create one.

Once you have an account on [last.fm](https://last.fm), click on the top right of the screen (click on your avatar) and then click on "Settings".

Click on "Applications" and next to "Spotify Scrobbling", click on "Connect".

Then log into your Spotify account and connect.

## Step 3: Last.fm API

Once your spotify account linked to last.fm, go to https://www.last.fm/api/account/create and fill in:

        "Contact email": Leave as it is.

        "Application name": fullscreen-spotify

        "Application description": An application that displays the current song you're listening to in fullscreen.

Leave blank the rest blank.

Once you pressed "Submit", you'll get an api key and a shared secret key, note them somewhere safe but don't share these with anyone.

## Step 4: config.json

Once you have your api and secret key, go to the "config.json" file (in the "src" folder) and edit it using a text editor like Visual Studio Code, Atom or even Notepad++.

Next to "apiKey", change "Replace with your own api key." with your own api key.

Next to "secret", change "Replace with your own secret key." with your own secret key.

Next to "username", change "Replace with your own last.fm username." with your own last.fm username.

Once this is done, save the "config.json" file.

## Step 5: Run

Let's see if it works.

First, open a command line and install all the dependencies by typing:

```js
npm install
```

then run

```js
npm start
```

If it works, you should see a black window.

Simply play a song on spotify and within 5 to 10 seconds, you should see it on this black window.

## Step 6: Building

Now's time to build an app instead of using the command line every time.

The command to do this is different for each Operating System.

**Windows:**

```js
npm run package-win
```

**macOS:**

```js
npm run package-mac
```

**Linux:**

```js
npm run package-linux
```

Once the command run, you'll see a new folder called "release-builds".

In there you'll see the "fullscreen-spotify" application!

Run it and enjoy your fullscreen spotify!
